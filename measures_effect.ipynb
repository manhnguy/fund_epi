        "In analytical studies, we often aim investigate risk factors of an outcome. If we suspect that a particular factor may be causing a specific outcome, we first look for an association between the factor and the outcome. To do this, we compare the occurrence of the outcome in a group of people that has been 'exposed' to the factor, with the occurrence in a group of people that has not been 'exposed'. We use ratio measures or difference measures. \n",

        "There are three commonly used measures of **disease frequency** in epidemiology: we have called these the odds, the risk, and the rate. The numerator in all of three of these is the number of cases occurring within a defined period of time. The difference is in the denominator: the odds uses the number of non-cases within the same time period, the risk uses the number of individuals at the beginning of the follow-up period, and the rate uses the person-time at risk during the follow-up period. The ratio of odds, risks or rates between two groups gives the respective **measures of effect**: the odds ratio, the risk ratio and the rate ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the literature, however, it is common to see these terms used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In particular, the term **risk** is often used generically to refer to any of the above measures of **disease frequency**. To complicate things further, some of these measures have other names: the risk is also sometimes referred to as the cumulative risk, while the rate is sometimes known as the incidence density. In infectious disease epidemiology, the force of infection is used to describe the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\n",
