# Preface {.unnumbered}

I am on a journey to pursue my master's degree. I started writing this book as a way to summarize what I have learned from the course. It will be basic and may contain some errors or mistakes. If you have time to go through it, I would be grateful for your feedback. Most of the content here is taken from the Distant Learning Epidemiology Master's Programme provided by [London School of Hygene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/masters-degrees/epidemiology-online#overview), with some modifications taken from the Introduction to Biostatistics course provided by Prof. Ronald Geskus and his team at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh.
