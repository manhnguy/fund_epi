# Preface {.unnumbered}

I am on a journey to pursue my master's degree. I started writing this notes as a way to summarize what I have learned from the course. It will be basic and may contain some errors or mistakes. If you have time to go through it, I would be grateful for your feedback. Most of the content here is taken from the Distant Learning Epidemiology Master's Programme provided by [London School of Hygene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/masters-degrees/epidemiology-online#overview) (LSHTM), with some modifications taken from the book Modern Epidemiology, 4th edition [@lash_modern_2021] and the Introduction to Biostatistics course provided by Prof. Ronald Geskus and his team at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh.

Special thanks to [Dr. Thinh Ong](https://drthinhong.com/) for motivating me to work on this.
