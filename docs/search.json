    "text": "1.1 What is Epidemiology?\n\n“The study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, states, and processes in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems.” (Porta 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Snow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis study pump\n\n\n\n\n\nJhon Snow example: For short, in 19th century, cholera expand all over Europe and UK. Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:\n\nthat cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy\nthat disease is communicated by “morbid matter” which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks\nthat the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal\nwater supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy\n\nIn 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.\nComparison is fundamental to epidemiology Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups using different water sources, we can find the risk factors of a disease. However, in reality, comparison is also the most challenge of epidemiology with many sources of confusion and error.\nThe two key elements In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.\n\nThe exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.\nThe outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in."

Much progress has been made, particularly in understanding the causes of “non-communicable” diseases (for example, the links between H.pylori and gastric ulcer, and between EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) and Burkitts lymphoma).\nHowever new challenges continue to emerge. In recent decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), drug resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have all emerged as challenges to the public health. As an epidemiologist, you are unlikely to become bored!\nSource: EPM 101 LSHTM"

It is influenced by the occurrence of new cases (incidence, I) and the duration of each case (D): P= I x D.\nAs so many factors influence prevalence, it is difficult to interpret comparative studies of the prevalence of the same condition in different settings.\nIt can also be difficult to interpret the reasons for a change in the prevalence of a condition in the same location.\nHowever, prevalence studies provide useful information about the state of health of a community at a particular point in time, and so are useful for evaluating health-care needs and planning health service provision.\nThis is particularly important for chronic conditions that require health care resources throughout their duration.\nThe prevalence can also be used to evaluate the impact of preventative measures aimed at reducing the burden of a disease or condition in a community.\nHowever, because of the number of factors that influence prevalence, any comparative results need to be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPrevalence is useful for chronic diseases that require health resource. It can be used for evaluating health-care needs and planning.\nIncidence risk provides good evidence for studying causality when the outcome of interest is uncommon or acute diseases and the population is static.\nIncidence rate is useful when the population is dynamic, the outcome of interest is common or the population at high risk(the number of new cases will be relatively high) or can occur many times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLash, Timothy L., Tyler J.
