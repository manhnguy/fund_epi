    "text": "Epidemiology is a young science that has developed particularly rapidly over the last 50 years, as new techniques of analysis have been developed. Much progress has been made, particularly in understanding the causes of “non-communicable” diseases (for example, the links between H.pylori and gastric ulcer, and between EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) and Burkitts lymphoma).\nHowever new challenges continue to emerge. In recent decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), drug resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have all emerged as challenges to the public health. As an epidemiologist, you are unlikely to become bored!\nSource: EPM 101 LSHTM"

Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:\n\nthat cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy\nthat disease is communicated by “morbid matter” which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks\nthat the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal\nwater supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy\n\nIn 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.\nComparison is fundamental to epidemiology Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups using different water sources, we can find the risk factors of a disease. However, in reality, comparison is also the most challenge of epidemiology with many sources of confusion and error.\nThe two key elements In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.\n\nThe exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.\nThe outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in."

We use a ratio measure in analytical studies as one piece of evidence in judging whether an exposure causes an outcome.\nDifference measures quantify the difference in incidence between an exposed and an unexposed population. We use difference measures when a causal association between an exposure and an outcome has already been established, to estimate the risk that is attributable to exposure in the exposed group.\nThe measures covered in this session are appropriate where the exposure measure is a categorical variable. They cannot, therefore, be used to analyse continuous exposure variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTerminology\nThere are three commonly used measures of disease frequency in epidemiology: we have called these the odds, the risk, and the rate. The numerator in all of three of these is the number of cases occurring within a defined period of time. The difference is in the denominator: the odds uses the number of non-cases within the same time period, the risk uses the number of individuals at the beginning of the follow-up period, and the rate uses the person-time at risk during the follow-up period. The ratio of odds, risks or rates between two groups gives the respective measures of effect: the odds ratio, the risk ratio and the rate ratio.\nIn the literature, however, it is common to see these terms used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In particular, the term risk is often used generically to refer to any of the above measures of disease frequency. To complicate things further, some of these measures have other names: the risk is also sometimes referred to as the cumulative risk, while the rate is sometimes known as the incidence density. In infectious disease epidemiology, the force of infection is used to describe the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\nMake it clear what you are measuring in your study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorta, Miquel. 2014.

    "section": "4.1 What is Bias",
    "text": "4.1 What is Bias\nThere are more than 20 types of bias in the Dictionary of Epidemiology book (Porta 2014). They are defined inconsistently in different fields. Some authors regard confounding as a type of bias.\nIn Epidemiology, bias refers to any systematic error in the design or conduct of an epidemiological study that results in an incorrect estimate of the association between exposure and outcome (risk of disease).\nIn confounding, the associations do exist in the population of interest, however, they are not causal but rather explained by association with another factor. The effect of confounding can be controlled in our analysis.\nBy contrast, when bias occurs the associations are not ‘there’ at all, they only exist within your study. A biased study is one that does not give a true representation of the situation we want to describe or the association we want to analyse. We cannot control for the effect of bias in our analysis. Instead, we need to identify potential sources of bias and try to minimise them.\nIn this section, I will summary 2 main types of bias: Selection bias and Information bias.\n\n4.1.1 Selection Bias\nSelection bias refers to error due to systematic differences in characteristics between those who take part in a study and those who do not, such that\n\nthe people who are selected to participate in a study are not representative of the reference population\n\nor, in analytic studies,\n\nthe comparison groups are not comparable\n\nDescriptive studies (cross-sectional or cohort studies): bias occurs if the study population is not representative of the source population (the population that we draw our study population from). In cross-sectional studies, selection bias may occur because rarely 100% of individuals participate, and if there are differences in characteristics between those who participate and those who do not.\nExample:\nAnalytical Studies:\n1. Case control studies\n\ncases are not representative of all cases within a defined population (all eligible cases), or\ncontrols are not representative of the population which produced the cases.\n\n2. Cohort Studies\n\npoor choice of the unexposed group, or\ndifferences in follow-up between the comparison groups\n\nMissing data can be considered as a form of selection bias. It is important to describe the extent and the patterns of missing data, comparing individuals with and without missing data for key variables. This helps us to make assumptions about the nature of the missing data, and to assess the effect the missingness could have on our analyses.\n\n\n4.1.2 Information Bias\nReporting bias\n\nwhen study participants with a specific health outcome report previous exposures with a different degree of accuracy to those without the outcome, or\nwhen study participants who have experienced a specific exposure report subsequent health events with a different degree of accuracy to those who have not experienced the exposure.\n\nObserver bias\n\nin case-control or cross-sectional studies, when the accuracy of exposure data recorded by the investigator differs systematically between study participants in different outcome groups or\nin cohort or intervention studies, when the accuracy of outcome data recorded by the investigator differs systematically between individuals in different exposure groups"
