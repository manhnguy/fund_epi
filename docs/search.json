It will be basic and may contain some errors or mistakes. If you have time to go through it, I would be grateful for your feedback. Most of the content here is taken from the Distant Learning Epidemiology Master’s Programme provided by London School of Hygene and Tropical Medicine, with some modifications taken from the book Modern Epidemiology, 4th edition (Lash et al. 2021) and the Introduction to Biostatistics course provided by Prof. Ronald Geskus and his team at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh.\n\n\n\n\nLash, Timothy L., Tyler J.

Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:\n\nthat cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy\nthat disease is communicated by “morbid matter” which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks\nthat the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal\nwater supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy\n\nIn 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.\nComparison is fundamental to epidemiology Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups, we can find the risk factors of a disease.\nThe two key elements In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.\n\nThe exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.\nThe outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in."
