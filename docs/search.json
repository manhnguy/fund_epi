    "text": "1.1 What is Epidemiology?\n\n“The study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, states, and processes in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems.” (Porta 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Snow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis study pump\n\n\n\n\n\nJhon Snow example: For short, in 19th century, cholera expand all over Europe and UK. Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:\n\nthat cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy\nthat disease is communicated by “morbid matter” which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks\nthat the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal\nwater supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy\n\nIn 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.\nComparison is fundamental to epidemiology Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups using different water sources, we can find the risk factors of a disease. However, in reality, comparison is also the most challenge of epidemiology with many sources of confusion and error.\nThe two key elements In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.\n\nThe exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.\nThe outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in."

Much progress has been made, particularly in understanding the causes of “non-communicable” diseases (for example, the links between H.pylori and gastric ulcer, and between EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) and Burkitts lymphoma).\nHowever new challenges continue to emerge. In recent decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), drug resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have all emerged as challenges to the public health.

The numerator in all of three of these is the number of cases occurring within a defined period of time. The difference is in the denominator: the odds uses the number of non-cases within the same time period, the risk uses the number of individuals at the beginning of the follow-up period, and the rate uses the person-time at risk during the follow-up period. The ratio of odds, risks or rates between two groups gives the respective measures of effect: the odds ratio, the risk ratio and the rate ratio.\nIn the literature, however, it is common to see these terms used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In particular, the term risk is often used generically to refer to any of the above measures of disease frequency. To complicate things further, some of these measures have other names: the risk is also sometimes referred to as the cumulative risk, while the rate is sometimes known as the incidence density. In infectious disease epidemiology, the force of infection is used to describe the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\nMake it clear what you are measuring in your study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorta, Miquel. 2014.
