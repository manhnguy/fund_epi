    "text": "Epidemiology is a young science that has developed particularly rapidly over the last 50 years, as new techniques of analysis have been developed. Much progress has been made, particularly in understanding the causes of “non-communicable” diseases (for example, the links between H.pylori and gastric ulcer, and between EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) and Burkitts lymphoma).\nHowever new challenges continue to emerge. In recent decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), drug resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have all emerged as challenges to the public health.

Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:\n\nthat cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy\nthat disease is communicated by “morbid matter” which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks\nthat the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal\nwater supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy\n\nIn 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.\nComparison is fundamental to epidemiology Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups using different water sources, we can find the risk factors of a disease. However, in reality, comparison is also the most challenge of epidemiology with many sources of confusion and error.\nThe two key elements In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.\n\nThe exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.\nThe outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in."

We use a ratio measure in analytical studies as one piece of evidence in judging whether an exposure causes an outcome.\nDifference measures quantify the difference in incidence between an exposed and an unexposed population. We use difference measures when a causal association between an exposure and an outcome has already been established, to estimate the risk that is attributable to exposure in the exposed group.\nThe measures covered in this session are appropriate where the exposure measure is a categorical variable. They cannot, therefore, be used to analyse continuous exposure variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTerminology\nThere are three commonly used measures of disease frequency in epidemiology: we have called these the odds, the risk, and the rate. The numerator in all of three of these is the number of cases occurring within a defined period of time. The difference is in the denominator: the odds uses the number of non-cases within the same time period, the risk uses the number of individuals at the beginning of the follow-up period, and the rate uses the person-time at risk during the follow-up period. The ratio of odds, risks or rates between two groups gives the respective measures of effect: the odds ratio, the risk ratio and the rate ratio.\nIn the literature, however, it is common to see these terms used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In particular, the term risk is often used generically to refer to any of the above measures of disease frequency. To complicate things further, some of these measures have other names: the risk is also sometimes referred to as the cumulative risk, while the rate is sometimes known as the incidence density. In infectious disease epidemiology, the force of infection is used to describe the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected.\nMake it clear what you are measuring in your study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorta, Miquel. 2014.

    "section": "4.1 What is Bias",
    "text": "4.1 What is Bias\nThere are more than 20 types of bias in the Dictionary of Epidemiology book (Porta 2014). They are defined inconsistently in different fields. Some authors regard confounding as a type of bias.\nIn Epidemiology, bias refers to any systematic error in the design or conduct of an epidemiological study that results in an incorrect estimate of the association between exposure and outcome (risk of disease).\nIn confounding, the associations do exist in the population of interest, however, they are not causal but rather explained by association with another factor. The effect of confounding can be controlled in our analysis.\nBy contrast, when bias occurs the associations are not ‘there’ at all, they only exist within your study. A biased study is one that does not give a true representation of the situation we want to describe or the association we want to analyse. We cannot control for the effect of bias in our analysis. Instead, we need to identify potential sources of bias and try to minimise them.\nIn this section, I will summary 2 main types of bias: Selection bias and Information bias.\n\n4.1.1 Selection Bias\nSelection bias refers to error due to systematic differences in characteristics between those who take part in a study and those who do not, such that\n\nthe people who are selected to participate in a study are not representative of the reference population\n\nor, in analytic studies,\n\nthe comparison groups are not comparable\n\nDescriptive studies (cross-sectional or cohort studies): bias occurs if the study population is not representative of the source population (the population that we draw our study population from). In cross-sectional studies, selection bias may occur because rarely 100% of individuals participate, and if there are differences in characteristics between those who participate and those who do not.\nExample:\nAnalytical Studies:\n1. Case control studies\n\ncases are not representative of all cases within a defined population (all eligible cases), or\ncontrols are not representative of the population which produced the cases.\n\n2. Cohort Studies\n\npoor choice of the unexposed group, or\ndifferences in follow-up between the comparison groups\n\nMissing data can be considered as a form of selection bias. It is important to describe the extent and the patterns of missing data, comparing individuals with and without missing data for key variables. This helps us to make assumptions about the nature of the missing data, and to assess the effect the missingness could have on our analyses.\n\n\n4.1.2 Information Bias\nReporting bias\n\nwhen study participants with a specific health outcome report previous exposures with a different degree of accuracy to those without the outcome, or\nwhen study participants who have experienced a specific exposure report subsequent health events with a different degree of accuracy to those who have not experienced the exposure.\n\nObserver bias\n\nin case-control or cross-sectional studies, when the accuracy of exposure data recorded by the investigator differs systematically between study participants in different outcome groups or\nin cohort or intervention studies, when the accuracy of outcome data recorded by the investigator differs systematically between individuals in different exposure groups"

    "text": "8.2 Main steps in conducting a Cross-sectional study\nStep 1: Defining the study question\nStep 2: Defining the target population and selecting the study population\nRefer to Measures of Occurrence section for definition of different concepts of population. Basically, the target population is the group to which we can generalise our study results, while the study population consists of the individuals we intend to include in our study. If the target population is small, we can study the entire population. However, in practice, the study population is usually a sample of the target population.\nIt is important to select the sample as representative of the target population, otherwise we will introduce selection bias in our study. The best way to ensure this is random sampling: Simple random sampling, Systematic sampling, Stratified sampling, Multi-stage sampling.\nMost of the time, not all individuals of our target population will participate in our study even though we have tried our best. We should collect as much as possible information about those who do not participate. If there is systematic different characteristics between those who participate and those who do not, there is selection bias in our study. And, We should report as much information as possible about the non-participant.\nStep 3: Collecting data\nHave a clear case and exposure definitions Measure of Occurrence before collecting any data. We then collect data on both outcomes and exposures simultaneously.\nMethods used for collecting data could be: personal interviews, questionnaires, medical records, physical examinations, diagnostic tests, or any combination of these. The data should be collected in standardised way.\nStep 4: Analysing data\nIn Descriptive study: We quantify the prevalence and often report this in different gender and age groups.\nIn Analytical study: We quantify the association between exposure and outcome of interest using Prevalence ratio.\nStep 5: Interpreting results\n\nBias in cross-sectional studies\nSelection bias may occur as we cannot have 100% individuals participate in our study\nInformation bias\n\nRecall bias: if the individuals with the outcome are more of less likely to recall having been exposed to the risk factor risk factors. We can minimise this bias by trying to use objective data, not telling participants about the association under the study.\nObserver bias: If the researchers is more or less likely to decide that the outcome is present in individuals who have the exposure under study. We can minimise this bias by having a strict definition of outcome, using standardised methods of data collection or ensure the researcher who measure the outcome is blinded to the exposure status of the participants.\n\nConfounding in cross-sectional studies\nWe must be aware of all potential confounders and collect data on these confounders at the start of the study. In analysing step, we should check for the evidence of confounding using the 3 necessary criteria and assess how the confounders distort the association.\n\nCross-sectional study measure the prevalence which is influenced by many factors: severity of cases, access to curative treatment, survival. It’s difficult to intepret the reasons for the differing prevalences in different populations.\nData on exposure and outcome are collected at the same time. It can be difficult to tell whether outcome really occur after or before exposure. if it occurs before the exposure we call reverse causality. We can only be sure that the exposure occurred before the outcome if it is fixed characteristic of the individual(e.g. gender, age, blood group….)."

We then compare the frequency of the outcome of interest among the group that was exposed to the risk factor with the group that was unexposed\nWhy do Cohort study?\n\nCohort studies are particularly useful for rare exposures and in situations where we are interested in more than one outcome.\nBecause exposure status is defined at the start of the study, before the outcome is assessed, the temporal sequence of events can be investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDifference between Cohort and Case-control study\nCohort study: We have exposure data on all those in the study population who develop the outcome, and all those who do not.\nCase-control study: we collect exposure data on all cases and controls. However, the controls are only a sub-set of the study population of “non-cases” rather than all non-cases in the study population."

    "text": "9.2 Main steps in conducting a Cohort study\nStep 1: Defining the study question\nStep 2: Defining the target population and selecting the study population\nThe study population should be free of outcome at the start of the the study\na Common exposure We can select a population of people and classify each individual, at the start of the study, as exposed or unexposed. We then follow up the exposed and unexposed groups to determine the frequency of the outcome in each exposure group.\nThis is called using an internal comparison group because we compare the exposed to the unexposed within the same population.\nb Rare exposure A sample of the general population is unlikely to include enough people who have been exposed. In this case we need to select a group of people who are known to have been exposed, and then choose a suitable comparison group.\n\ninternal comparison group: we may able to use unexposed group in the same population. The exposed and unexposed groups will likely be comparable. Work-force cohorts are a popular cohort design. However, these cohorts are generally not representative of the general population. All workforces differ from the general population because they are healthy enough to be in work, and some work cohorts (such as doctors or nurses) are likely to be better educated and more health-conscious than the general population. In an analytic cohort study, it is not essential that the study population is representative of the general population. We refer to the extent to which our results can be generalised to other populations as external validity (or generalisability).\nexternal comparison group: If all individuals in the study population have some degree of the exposure, we may need to use unexposed group from different population. We need to be more careful that our exposed and unexposed groups are comparable, except with respect to the exposure of interest. If the exposed and unexposed groups are not comparable this would threaten the internal validity of our study.\n\nSometimes we may decide to use more than one unexposed comparison group and compare the exposed group with each unexposed group.\nStep 3: Measuring exposure\nAccurate measurement of exposure and classification of exposure status is important. Several data source can be used to measure the exposure:\n\ninterviews with study participants\nmedical records\nemployment records\nbiological specimens\n\nExposure is often a continuous variable, we can stratify a continuous variable into categorical variable. However, it is better to collect the exact values and stratify in the analysis step.\nIf we use external comparison group, we need to be sure that the unexposed group is genuinely exposed to the exposure of interest.\nThe exposure can change during the follow up and we need to use special analytical techniques to take account of this changes.\nWe also need to measure potential confounding factors at the start of the study.\nCohort studies can be prospective (also called concurrent) or historical (also called retrospective). This refers to the time at which exposure data were measured.\nHistorical cohort study\nAdvantage: much faster to perform, useful for diseases with a long period between exposure and outcome\nDisadvantage: data on exposure (and potential confounders) may be less accurate. Most of the time, data have been collected for different purposes.\nProspective cohort study\nAdvantage: data can be collected with more accurate and complete focus on the objectives of the study.\nDisadvantage: It can take long time to complete the study and if losses to follow up is large and there is difference between loss to follow up witht the group that complete follow up, selection bias may be introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAlthough historical cohort studies are often referred to as retrospective cohort studies, we prefer to avoid this term as we believe it can be confusing. Conceptually, all cohort studies are prospective because they look forward in time from exposure to disease. This is in contrast with case control studies which are sometimes referred to as retrospective studies because they look back in time from disease to exposure. The key point to remember is that regardless of whether we are using historical data or real time data, in cohort studies the exposure status is always recorded before the outcome.\n\n\nStep 4: Follow-up of participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIncomplete follow-up is the main potential weakness of cohort studies.\n\n\nMinimise losses to follow up by regular interviews, face-to-face or by telephone, or postal questionnaires, and possibly a back-up system for tracing participants who do not respond.\nWe should consider latency time when design a cohort study. If the latency time is too long (many years), we may consider historical cohort study.\nStep 5: Ascertaining outcome\nStep 6: Analysing data\nRisks are useful when the follow-up time is identical (or nearly identical) for all members of the cohort. However, if there is wide variation between study participants in the duration of follow-up, we must take this into account. In this situation, it would be better to calculate a rate.\nFor analytical cohort study, we use risk/rate ratio/difference to compare the 2 groups.\nIf there are more than 2 levels of the exposure, we need to choose a level as a baseline that we use to compare with other levels. This baseline level is usually one of the least or no exposure. If there are few events in this group (very small number), we need to choose another level as baseline as the CI will be wide.\nNote about the changes in exposure.\nStep 7: Interpreting results\n\nBias\n1 Selection bias:\n\nif the unexposed group is not correctly selected\nif there is differential loss to follow-up between exposure groups\n\n2 Information bias:\nObserver bias:\n\nIf the researcher knows about the exposure status, s/he might mis-stratify the outcome.\nIf the participants know about the study question, s/he might report inaccurate outcome.\n\nThese problems can be minimised by having a strict case definition for the outcome of interest, by using objective measures. We can also try to blind person who carry out diagnosis the outcome to the exposure status of the participant and blind the participants about the hypothesis under the study (concern about ethic)\nConfounding\nAs all observational studies, we should collect all information on potential confounders together with the exposure of interest at the start of the study.\nRandom errors"

    "text": "10.2 Main steps in conducting a Cohort study\nStep 1: Defining the study question\nStep 2: Defining the target population\nStep 3: Selecting the cases\nThe cases must be a clear defined group with 3 properties:\na. case definition refer to Measure of Occurrence section.\nb. Source\nWe must define the population from which the cases are drawn, because the controls will need to be drawn from the same population. The cases could be:\n\nall patients who fulfil the case definition who attend a specific hospital within a specified time period\nall patients within a specified population who have the outcome in question within a specified time period. We might need to use multiple sources of data to identify all such patients.\n\nWe need to clarify the case group represent all cases in the target population or just a subgroup of cases. If we are studying a common disease, we may not want to study all cases within a given population. If we decide to study a sample of cases, then this sample should be a representative sample of all possible cases who fulfil the case definition within the specified population.\nFor some diseases with a spectrum of severity, patients from a hospital population are likely to have more severe disease than those from a primary care setting.\nc. Incident or prevalent cases\nIf we use incident cases, we will identify risk factors associated with the onset of the disease. However if we use prevalent cases, we will under-represent cases with more rapidly progressive disease who die rapidly after diagnosis, and are therefore less likely to be included in the study. Thus if we use prevalent cases in a case-control study, any risk factors identified as associated with the disease may be not just those associated with the development of the disease, but could also be those associated with longer survival with the disease.\nStep 4: Selecting appropriate controls\nControls must be representative of the population that produced the cases, but must not have the outcome in question. We can consider how to select the cases with 4 questions:\nwhat should be the source of controls?\n1, If the cases are a population based sample of incidences, population based controls would be appropriate (a random sample of the same population without the outcome of interest)\nData sources could be:\n\nlists of people registered with a primary care physician\nlists of people cared for by a village health worker\ncensus data\n\nNote: all of these data courses have some limitations, 1 source is unlikely to provide a complete accurate information.\n2, If cases are derived from a health care facility, many studies use controls from the same health facility. Because these controls are easy to recruit, more likely to participate with less losses of follow up. However, these controls may not be representative of the population which produced the cases and selection bias maybe introduced.\nshould there be more than one group of controls?\nIdeally we should have 1 control group but sometimes we need more than one.\nhow many controls per case?\nNo more than 4 controls per cases.\nshould the controls be matched to the case?\nWe make our study more efficient if we match on a few simple variables (such as age and sex). However, if we try to match on many variables it becomes increasingly difficult to find appropriate matched controls for each case.\nMatching types:\nIndividual matching: a control is selected match to a cases on a few desired variables.\nGroup matching: Instead of matching each individual, we select control group match to the case group. e.g. case group contains 60% male, and mean age 25, we should recruit a control group with similar sex and age distribution. This usually requires that all the cases be chosen before we start to select controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMatching does not remove the confounding effect. Matched studies require an analysis that takes the matching into account.\nWe should only match for an exposure if the relationship between that exposure and the outcome is already understood.\nMatching on an intermediate variable results an underestimate of the association between the exposure and outcome of interest.\nMatching on a variable that is associated with the exposure of interest but not with the outcome can reduce the efficiency of the study and weaken our ability to detect an association.\n\n\nNested case-control study\nNested case-control study is carried out within a cohort study with 2 advantages:\n\nboth cases and controls are derived from the same population. Controls are representative of non-cases population, thus reduce selection bias.\nexposure is identified before outcome occurred, reduce information bias and have less risk of reverse causality.\n\nMore than 1 nested case-control study can be carried out within a single cohort study.\nStep 5: Measuring exposure\nPossible source of exposure data:\n\ninterview of participants\ninterview of a person close to the study participant\nmedical records\noccupational records\nbiological samples\n\nWe need to consider the latency time as this determines the period we should collect exposure information.\nwe must be sure that the method used to gather information is as accurate for cases as it is for controls:\n\nuse objective records rather than subjective measures to measure exposure status when possible, providing they are accurate\nuse measures of exposure taken before the outcome occurred (which are therefore less likely to be biased by outcome status) when possible.\nif there are no pre-existing sources of exposure data, and the measurement of exposure requires a subjective judgement by the investigator, make the investigator “blind” to the outcome status of the participant.\n\nStep 6: Analysing the data\nwe compare the prevalence of exposure among cases with that among controls.\nwe usually use odds to express the frequency of the exposure among the groups of cases and controls. We compare the odds of exposure among cases and controls by calculating the ratio of the odds of exposure.\na) Incident cases\nthere are three strategies for the sampling of controls and the measures of effect vary dependent on the strategy.\n\nIf we sample a control from the population at the same time a case is identified, the exposure odds ratio estimates the rate ratio.\nIf we sample our controls from the source population at the beginning of identification of incident cases the exposure odds ratio estimates the risk ratio.\nIf we sample our controls from the source population at the end of identification of cases the exposure odds ratio estimates the odds ratio (of disease).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn the situation of a rare disease the exposure odds ratio for all three strategies of sampling estimates the risk ratio, rate ratio and odds ratio of disease. This is because when the disease is rare in the study population, the odds ratio, risk ratio and rate ratio are all very similar numerically.\n\n\nb) Prevalent cases\nIf we select controls at the time of identification of cases (prevalent controls), the odds ratio estimates the prevalence odds ratio.\nUnder certain assumptions, most importantly that the duration of the disease is not associated with exposure, the prevalence odds ratio estimates the rate ratio. If the disease is rare the prevalence odds ratio estimates the prevalence ratio.\nNote:\n\nThere may be more than one level of exposure, in which case we calculate an odds ratio for each stratum compared to the baseline. The baseline is often the unexposed group (or lowest level of exposure) but a different stratum may be chosen as a baseline, particularly if there are few cases in the unexposed group (which would make the estimate of disease occurrence in that stratum unreliable.\nAn individually matched design requires a matched analysis, and the odds ratio is calculated differently using ‘discordant pairs’. The analysis of individually matched data is discussed in the module Statistics for Epidemiology (EPM102).\nGroup-matched (or frequency-matched) studies do not need a ‘discordant pairs’ analysis. However, we should still treat the matched variable as a potential confounder, and adjust for it in the normal way through stratification or regression modelling.\n\nStep 7: Interpreting results"
