## What is Epidemiology?

> "The study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, states, and processes in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems." [@porta2014]

**The two key elements** that we measure in most epidemiological studies are the exposure and the outcome.

-   The exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.

-   The outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in.

## what is the role of Epidemiology?

Epidemiology has four major functions:

-   to **describe** patterns of health and disease within populations

-   to **interpret** these differences

-   to **apply** our results to public health practice, and

-   to **evaluate** the effect of health-related interventions
