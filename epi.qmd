## What is Epidemiology?

> "The study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, states, and processes in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems." [@porta_dictionary_2014]

**John Snow** example: 
For short, in 19th century, cholera expand all over Europe and UK. Estimated 15,000 recorded deaths in London in 1848-9. Snow (an anaesthetist) came up with some hypothesis:

-   that cholera can be communicated from the sick to the healthy

-   that disease is communicated by "morbid matter" which has the property of multiplying in the body of the person it attacks

-   that the morbid matter producing cholera must be introduced into the alimentary canal

-   water supplies appeared to be able to disseminate the morbid matter from the sick to the healthy

In 1853, cholera reappeared and Snow started his study. First he did a descriptive study by collecting information on cholera deaths, where they live and the population of the area. Then he look at the association of the water sources and the risk of death from cholera.  

**Comparison** is fundamental to epidemiology
Just as Snow did, by looking at the difference of risk between the groups using different water sources, we can find the risk factors of a disease. However, in reality, comparison is also the most challenge of epidemiology with many sources of confusion and error. 

**The two key elements** 
In most epidemiological studies, we would measure 2 key elements which are the exposure and the outcome.

-   The exposure (sometimes called risk factor or determinant) is any factor that may influence the outcome.

-   The outcome is the disease, or event, or health-related state, that we are interested in.

## what is the role of Epidemiology?

Epidemiology has four major functions:

-   to **describe** patterns of health and disease within populations

-   to **interpret** these differences

-   to **apply** our results to public health practice, and

-   to **evaluate** the effect of health-related interventions

## Differences between Epidemiology and Public Health

This is a controversial discussion. I tend to think of Public Health as focused on  practice, while Epidemiology is the study of evidence that supports Public Health.

**Epidemiology**

***What it is:*** The science of studying how diseases occur, spread, and can be controlled in populations.

<!-- ***Key functions:*** -->

<!-- Measures incidence and prevalence -->

<!-- Identifies risk factors and disease determinants -->

<!-- Designs and analyzes studies (like cohort, case-control, and outbreak investigations) -->

***Core purpose:*** To understand the distribution (who gets sick, when, and where) and determinants (why and how) of health events, which lays the groundwork for action.

**Public Health**

***What it is:*** A broad discipline focused on promoting health, preventing disease, and prolonging life through organized community efforts.

***Key functions:***

Sets health policies and programs

Implements interventions (like vaccination campaigns and health education)

Monitors health through surveillance

Evaluates policies and programs for effectiveness and equity

***Core purpose:*** To translate evidence into action that improves health at the population level.

**Relationship Between the Two**

| Epidemiology                                | Public Health                                |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Provides evidence, trends, and causes       | Uses evidence to develop actionable programs |
| Identifies health risks and trends          | Implements policies and interventions        |
| Evaluates risk factors and outcomes         | Focuses on prevention, policy, and health systems |

This epidemiological studies family tree is simpler than the one introduced by Ronald.
